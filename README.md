This is a data science project that involves using a given dataset to create a model, train the model based on the dataset and test the model using the same dataset.
After collection of the dataset, i cleaned the dataset, i splitted it into two splits that is the train and test datasets.
After spliting the dataset, i build a model using the dataset.
After building process i evaluated the model using the same dataset.
After evaluation i tested the performance of the model.
Finally i did comparison of the models (Linear Regression and Random forest model)

The link to the dataset is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv
